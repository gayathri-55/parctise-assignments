1.Run a script and demonstrate adding two integers and convert them into hexadecimal?
$a=10
$b=20
$c=$a + $b
30
To convert an interger to hexadecimal the command used in powershell is 0x
for example: ps> 0xae
             174
             ps> 0x30
             48

2.Run a script and demonstrate ifelse if condition?
$choco="diarymilk"
$choco1="kitkat"
if($choco -eq"dairymilk") {"I love choco"} elseif($choco="kitkat") {"I hate choco"}
I love choco
It checks the if condition if that condition is true it will print i love choco otherwise it will go to elseif and prints i hate choco.
if the if condition is true then it will not go to the else if part.

3.Run a script and demonstrate about get-commands, get-update, get-unique, get-date and get-alias?
get-command : this will display all the commands that are used in the powershell with the commandtype and name of the command.
get-date : it displays the current date and time.
get-process : it displays all the processess that are running on the system.
get-alias : it displays all the alias names for the commands that we use in powershell.
write-host : it is used to display whatever we right next to the command write-host.


PYTHON:

1.Work on different variables in python?
we can declare and define different variables in python but those variables have some rules and conditions, they are:
.A variable name can start with any alphabet that may of lowercase or uppercase.
.A variable name can start with an underscore or can end with an underscore.
.A variable name cannot start with an integer or any number.
.It can be of alphanumeric name.

2.Work on string concatination?
String concatination is adding or combining two strings.
In python we can concate the strings as follows:
string1="gayathri"
string2="nusimala"
print(string1+string2)
gayathrinusimala
but it is not possible to add a string and an integer if we do so we will get an error.
 
3.write a program of simple calculator using dynamic input?
operation=input(select operator: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division)
num1=input("enter the num1")
num2=input(:enter the num2")
if operator=='+':
print(num1+num2)
elif operator=='-':
print(num1-num2)
elif operator=='*':
print(num1*num2)
elif operator=='/':
print(num1/num2)
else:
print("invalid")

output:
+
2
3
5

4.Find the type of available datatypes in python?
The datatypes in python are
interger, float, bool, complex, string
To find the type of datatype in pythonwe have to write
type()
for example:  a="gayathri"
	      print(type(a))
	      output: string.

5.Functions in python?
A function in python is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.We can pass parameters as data intothe function.
syntax: def function_name(parameters):
            """"docstring""""""
               statements(s)

6.String functions?
We have many string functions in python.
some of the functions used in python are:
capitalize() - converts the first character to uppercase.
casefold() - converts the string into lowercase.
center() - -returns the centered string.
count() - returns the number of times a specific character is occured.
replace() - replace the specific string with another.
