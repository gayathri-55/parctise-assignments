1.Work on assignment operator in python?
Assignment operators are used to assign the values of right operand to the left operand.
various assignment operators are:
+=, -=, /=, *=, **=, //=, !=, ^=, >>=, <<=.
eg: a=10	
    b=20	
    a+=b
    print(a)
output:30

2.work on comparision operators?
Comparision operators compares the both operands and determines the relation between them.
It is also know as relational operator.
Some of the comparision operators are:
==,!=,<=,>=
eg: s=5
    g=9
    if(s>=g):
       print("s is big")
    elif(s==g):
       print("both are equal")
    elif(s!=g):
       print("both are not equal")
    else:
       print("g is big")
output: both are not equal.

3.work on bitwise operators?
Bitwise operators perform operation on binary pattern.
Some of the bitwise operators are:
&,|,^,<<,>>,~.
eg: x=2
    y=1
    print(x&y)
    print(x|y)
    print(x^y)
    print(x<<y)
    print(x>>y)
output:0
       3
       3 
       4
       1

4.work on tuples and dictionary?
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangable.
It is represented as tuple()
eg:mad=("doll","bat","ball")
   print(mad)
   print(mad[2])
output:("doll","bat","ball")
        bat
We have many operations to perform on tuples like finding lenght,negative indexing, etc..
But we cannot add or change the values of the tuples.

A dictionary is an unordered, changable and indexed.
Its is represented with the curly braces{}
eg:birds={"name":"parrot",
          "color":"green"}
   print(birds["color"])
   birds["color"]="white"
   print(birds["color"])
output:green
       white

5.Methods
seed()-used in generating random numbers
syntax:seed([x])
getstate-usedto capture the state and return the object of the random number generated with current state.
syntax:random.getstate()
randint()-used to generate a random number and return an integer number from the specific range.
syntax:random.randint()
randrange-used to return the selected element from the specific range.
syntax:random.randrange(start,stop,step)
choices()-used to return a random selected item of the list from the specified range of list or tuple or the other.
syntaxrandom.choices(sequence,weights=none,cum_weights=none,k=1)
shuffle()-used to randomize or shuffle the sequence of lists or tuple or other.
syntax:random.shuffle(sequence,function)
choice()-used to return the random sequence element from the list or tuple.
syntax:random.choice(sequence)
triangular()-used to return the random floating number from the two specified numbers you can also specify the third parameter.
syntax:random.triangle(low,high,mode)
uniform()- used to return a random float number from the two specified numbers
syntax:random.uniform(a,b)

6.write a python program to print prime numbers without using loops?
def prime_number(n, d):
    if n//2 < d:
     print("True")
    if n%d == 0:
      print("False")
    print(prime_number(n, d+1))

def find_primes(n,i, result):
  if i == n + 1:
    print(result)
  if prime_number(i, 2):
    result.append(i)
  print(find_primes(n, i+1, result))
print(find_primes(20,2, []))
output:[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
